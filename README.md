# Shad
 Terminal graphics editor written in C using notcurses library. Software is very unstable and works only on Linux.
 In this project, I experimented heavily with the ADT paradigm and used encapsulation to create a library of widgets. For more insight, take a look at ncpanel.h. 
 In this project I learned how to work with notcurses,
 how to structure GUI code without using OOP, as well as how to work with PNG format. 
 ## Dependencies
  Only notcurses
